# Electric-Vehicle-EV-Data-Case-Study

In this MySQL project, I analyzed an EV dataset using MySQL Workbench. I created tables, inserted data with DDL and DML commands, and analyzed it with DQL. I added constraints, used operators and clauses for filtering, sorted data with ORDER BY, and joined tables to retrieve comprehensive information.
